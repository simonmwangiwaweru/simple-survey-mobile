## Building APK (Android)

```bash

Requires an [Expo account](https://expo.dev) and EAS CLI.

## API

Connects to: `https://simple-survey-api-c3kj.onrender.com`

Configured in `src/lib/api.js`.

## Assumptions Made

- The mobile app is implemented as a WebView wrapper loading the live web application (https://simple-survey-web-one.vercel.app). This approach was chosen for reliability after native React Navigation modules caused consistent crashes on Android 14 devices.
- The app requires an internet connection to function as all data is fetched from the live API.
- Any updates to the web application are automatically reflected in the mobile app without requiring an APK rebuild.
- File downloads (certificates) are handled by opening the download URL in the device's default browser since Android WebViews do not support file downloads natively.
- The Android back button is handled to navigate back through web history rather than closing the app.
